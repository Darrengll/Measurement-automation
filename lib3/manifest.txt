This file contains statements that make a foundation of a new version of
library lib3.
New library version written from scratch + copypastes from production
version of `lib2`.

lib3 is mainly orieneted to be an API for quantum computing
calibrations/measurements/experiments/operations with
superconducting qubits (mostly transmons) in resonator+qubit (dispersive
readout) topology.

------------------------------------------------------------
Main statements:
1. All code has to comply with most recent PEP standards.
2. Every function is documented and comply with `numpy` library docstring
formaat.
3. Every measurement class has minimal working example attached as a code in
module containing this class. Simple measurement schematic neccessary to
perform measurement has to be attached as well.
4. NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY with previous library versions.
5. Single module contains at most 2 classes. The second class can be contained
if and only if module is associated with some measuremnet and the second class
inherits `MeasurementResult` for experiment result data visualization.
6. API has to allow optionally reload all modules required to
refresh the new measurement class instance to ensure all lib3
changes took place immediately.

### Physical units convention ###
time - nanoseconds
frequency - Hz
voltage - Volts
power - dBm = 20*log10(P/1mW), where P - power in mW, mW = 1e-3 Watt
resistance - Ohms

All numbering (e.g. AWG channels enumeration) begins at 0.
--------------------------------------------------------------
### Packages structure ###
The following package structure is proposed:
lib3/
    core/ - consists of Measurement and MeasurementResult. Context classes.
    Data save-load routines and so on.
    resonators/ - finding and fitting resonators
    mixers/ - package that regulates low level mixer-based schemes calibrations
    qchar/ - all necessary measurements that are required to characterize
    different aspects of qubit schemes.
        cw/ - STS/TTS/AC-stark and other CW measurements. TTS Spectrums fit.
            Couplings estimation based on fits. Qubit transitions frequencies.
        td/ - time-domain measurementsRabi/Ramsey and other pulsed measuremnets
            that results in lifetime estimation of a qubits. As well as
            pi-pulses calibration.
            Coupling estimation.
    qinf/ - quantum informatics experiments.
        tomo/ - tomography processes. May consist of several submodules.
